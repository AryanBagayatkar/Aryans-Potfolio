          <h4 className='lh-lg'>DoubtBot is an Artificial Intelligence bot designed to assist you with your queries and requirements. AI-powered bots are increasingly used these days to provide customer support, replacing human agents while offering 24/7 assistance. I have integrated the Botpress API, which is floating at the bottom-right corner of the screen. The bot is trained to perform mathematical calculations and more. It interacts with users through a single prompt, which can be customized based on the userâ€™s input.</h4>
